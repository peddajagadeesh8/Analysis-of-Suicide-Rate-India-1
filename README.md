### Data Analysis of suicides in India
Every year 703 000 people take their own life and there are many more people who attempt suicide. Each suicide is a personal tragedy that prematurely takes the life of an individual and has a continuing ripple effect, affecting the lives of families, friends and communities. World Health Organization tells that Suicide is a serious public health problem; however, suicides are preventable.
By analysing the suicidal trend and relationship between suicide rate and other factors we can find the root causes of the increasing suicide rate and from this analysis necessary actions will be taken to prevent the suicides and decrease suicide rate in India.
